# Math-Concepts-semantic-space
A study of the recent paper [Mapping and Modeling the semantic space of Math concepts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027724002579). Combining cognitive neuroscience and ML.
* The folders Embeddings, AnalysisPipeline and Vocabulary are taken from the paper official [code and data](https://osf.io/dxg2w/).
* The folder [Further-Analysis](https://github.com/dhia680/Math-Concepts-semantic-space/tree/603ebbc58472c9204e25f9fbdce5f7e5ffe7c21e/Further-Analysis) contains a code I wrote to explore modern embeddings (GPT2 large). The notebook is clear and commented. <br>
It uses in particular a chunk of the math-english vocabulary introduced in the paper whose words are well-represented by GPT2 tokenizer as single tokens, and analyzes them.
* The [pdf report](https://github.com/dhia680/Math-Concepts-semantic-space/blob/603ebbc58472c9204e25f9fbdce5f7e5ffe7c21e/Paper%20analysis%2Breview%2Bextension.pdf) contains an extensive analysis of the paper and presents the personal extension implemented in Further-Analysis.
