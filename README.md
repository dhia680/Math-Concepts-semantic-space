# Math-Concepts-semantic-space
A study of the recent paper [Mapping and Modeling the semantic space of Math concepts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027724002579).
* The folders Embeddings, AnalysisPipeline and Vocabulary are taken from the paper official implementation ([code](https://osf.io/dxg2w/))
* The folder Further-Analysis contains a code I wrote to explore modern embeddings (GPT2 large). The notebook is clear and commented. <br>
It uses in particular a chunk of the math-english vocabulary introduced in the paper that whose words are well-represented by GPT2 tokenizer as single tokens, and analyzes them.
